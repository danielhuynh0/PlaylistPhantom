Building upon a project I previously created (_nlp-playlistgen_) which generated playlists using a translation from text into song embeddings, and used different machine learning algorithms to generate playlists based on Euclidean distance in song embedding feature space, this new application features a user interface to allow for web interfacing, visualizations, ease of interaction, greater accessibility, as well as a much wider range of features!

**In the works**: A new Spotify API integration is in the works to directly add playlists to your Spotify account1
