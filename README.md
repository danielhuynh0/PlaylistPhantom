A new way to find new music through simply saying what's on your mind!

Building upon a project (_nlp-playlistgen_) I created to generate playlists using a translation from text into song embeddings, and the use of different machine learning algorithms to generate playlists based on Euclidean distance in song embedding feature space, this new application features a user interface to allow for web interfacing, visualizations, ease of interaction, greater accessibility, as well as a much wider range of features!

**In the works**: A new Spotify API integration is in the works to directly add playlists to your Spotify account1
